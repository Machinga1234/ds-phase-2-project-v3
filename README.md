2. Average Profit by Year
Observation: The average profitability of movies is highly volatile and unpredictable, with profitability spikes often driven by a few massive, hit-or-miss films.
B/s Recommendation: Focus on creating a diversified portfolio of films,(ie a  balance of lower-budget, lower-risk projects with a few high-concept blockbusters) to lower/reduce volatility while still pursuing high-profit opportunities.


3. Top 10 Genres by Average Profit

Observation: The most profitable films are not defined by a single genre, but by a strategic blend of genres, with fantasy and adventure being key components of the highest-earning combinations.

B/s Recommendation: Focus on producing films that combine multiple genres, specifically targeting high-profit blends such as "Adventure, Drama, Sport" or "Fantasy, Romance," to maximize your average return
